## How to Get to htyllm-pg Machine for Development

This explains how to access the `htyllm-pg` machine for development purposes.

**1. Generate and Add SSH Key:**

   - **On your local machine:** Open your terminal and generate a new SSH key pair:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen
     ```
     This will create a public and private key in `~/.ssh/`.

   - **Add the public key to GitLab:**
     - Go to your university's GitLab instance.
     - Click on your **Profile** icon.
     - Select **Edit profile**.
     - Navigate to **SSH Keys** in the sidebar.
     - Click **Add new key**.
     - Copy the content of your **public key file** (e.g., `~/.ssh/<your_keyfilename>.pub`) and paste it into the "Key" field.
     - Click **Add key**.

**2. Connect to the Gateway Server:**

   - Open your terminal and connect to the SSH gateway:
     ```bash
     ssh <your_uni_username>@sshgate.cs.upb.de
     ```
     Type in your uni password, if you are asked for it

**3. Connect to the Target Machine:**

   - Once logged into `sshgate.cs.upb.de`, connect to the `htyllm-pg` host:
     ```bash
     ssh <your_uni_username>@htyllm-pg.cs.uni-paderborn.de
     ```
   - You might be asked for your university password.

   - You should then be logged into `htyllm-pg.cs.uni-paderborn.de`. 
   
The machine has 32 cores and approximately 1TB of storage. For large datasets, use the `/data` directory. You should also have `sudo` rights.

## (Optional) Convenient Remote Development with VS Code

This enables you to directly login into the @htyllm-pg.cs.uni-paderborn.de host without the intermediate step of logging in into @sshgate.cs.upb.de
This is required if you want to develop remotely with vs code (as far as i know)

**### Set up Proxy Jump in SSH Configuration:**

   - **On your local machine:** Create or edit the SSH configuration file:
     ```
     ~/.ssh/config
     ```
   - Add the following content + adjust `User` and `IdentityFile`

     ```
     Host sshgate
         HostName sshgate.cs.upb.de
         User <your_uni_username>
         IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<your_private_key_file_name>  # Ensure this path is correct for your private key
         ForwardAgent yes

     Host htyllm-pg
         HostName htyllm-pg.cs.uni-paderborn.de
         User <your_uni_username>
         ProxyJump sshgate
         ForwardAgent yes
     ```

**### Set up VS Code Remote Development:**

   1. Install VS Code if you dont have it
   2. Install "Remote - SSH" Extension: Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view, search for "Remote - SSH", install it.
   3. Connect to Host: After installed the extension,  press F1, type "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...", and select the suggested command.
   4. Choose Target Host: VS Code should now recognize the `htyllm-pg` host from your SSH configuration. Select "htyllm-pg".
   5. Enter yor uni password when you are asked for it

You should then be connected to `htyllm-pg.cs.uni-paderborn.de` directly from VS Code. You can open your project folders and start developing. The integrated terminal in VS Code will also be directly connected to the `htyllm-pg` host.
I then suggest cloning the repository, creating a Python virtual environment, and installing the necessary requirements. You should then be ready to develop.
